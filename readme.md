# Kickstarting with Excel
***
## Overview of Project
A client is interested in creating a Kickstarter campaign for a theatrical play.  At this time, she is only interested in historical data around ideal launch dates and goal success.
### Purpose
I have been tasked with collecting and analyzing appropriate data to help guide her decision.
***
## Analysis and Challenges
Much of the collected data spans roughly 8 years and includes a full spectrum of categories.  I needed to filter out any data that was not related to plays.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
It appears that she will most benefit from launching her campaign in May, as pledges historically peeked around June with a steading decline thereafter.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the breakdown of the amount pledged, campaigns that had set goals between $1000 and $15,000 were the most successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
1. Outliers in the dataset.
2. Writing out the Goals table functions.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. Most campaigns experienced higher pledge volumes from May to August (summer months).
2. Pedges dropped drastically between October through March (winter months).
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Campaigns that had set goal amounts less than $15,000 were generally were about 75% successful.
2. While many non-play based campagins had canceled their Kickstarter effort, no play-related campaigns were canceled.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. The dataset included international campaigns that may reflect different economies, populations, and culturally specific special interests...any or all of which could have impacted outcomes. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Number of backers and the average pledge per campaign.
2. Goals by country; backer count  
3. Spotlight and staff pick: impact on pledges and backer count.
4. Campaign duration: success, failed, canceled
