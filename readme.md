# Kickstarting with Excel
***
## Overview of Project
***
A client is interested in creating a Kickstarter campaign for a theatrical play.  At this time, she is only interested in historical data around ideal launch dates and goal success.
### Purpose
***
I have been tasked with collecting and analyzing appropriate data to help guide her decision.
### Outcome Chart images

>[Project_Success_for_Plays]
## Analysis and Challenges
Much of the collected data spans roughly 8 years and includes a full spectrum of categories.  I needed to filter out any data that was not related to plays.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
It appears that she most benefit from launching her campaign in May, as pledges historically peeked around June with a steading decline thereafter.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
***
Based on the breakdown of amount pledges, campaigns that had set goals between $1000 and $15,000 were the most successful.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
***
1. Outliers in the dataset.
## Results
***
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. Most campaigns experienced higher pledge volumes from June to August.
2. Most of the successful campaigns ran for less than a year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Campaigns that had goal amounts that were less that $1000 tended to have significant failure rates.
2. Campaigns that had goal amounts between $1000 and $15,000 were the most successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. There was little "live" data.
2. The dataset included international campaigns that may reflect different economies, populations, and cultural/special interests which could impact and outcomes. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Number of backers: average pledge per campaign.
2. Goals: broken out by country; broken out by parent and subcategories.
